You can download a telraam dev image here:

This image has pi:pi credentials.
Please change the password for user pi and add your own user (with sudo rights) if you want access to the telraam.
User pi can get a new random password at the nightly update.

SSH service is not running by default, you have to enable it:
sudo systemctl enable ssh.service
sudo systemctl start ssh.service

SSH can be stopped during the nightly update.
If you want to use it, make sure to re-enable it after the maintenance window 0-4h.
