One Telraam user (@KoenVdH) designed a better camera mount, specifically for Telraam.
This design fixes several issues with the current camera mount (unreliable hinge, no need for anti-reflection, easier fix to the window).
This experimental design is available as an option in the self-assemble Telraam kit at Gotron.
You are invited to test and review the design.
